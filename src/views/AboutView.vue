                My name is Daniel Fredericks I was born on the 7th of January
                2002 and am currently am 20 years old. I am a student at life
                Choices Academy where I am studying coding in order to become a
                Web Developer in the future. My passsion for coding stems from
                my love of technology and anything related to it. I am a hard
                worker and am able to work well in groups as I believe that I am
                able to get along with people pretty well.
